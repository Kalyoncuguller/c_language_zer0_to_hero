// A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
 
union Data {
   int i;
   float f;
   char str[20];
};
 
int main( ) {

   union Data veri;        

   printf( "Memory size occupied by data : %d\n", sizeof(veri));

   return 0;
}
